#' Maize Data
#'
#' This dataset contains example optical, radar, and soil data for maize monitoring
#'
#' @format A data frame with 56 rows and 23 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Region}{Are the regions in the Argentine Pampas}
#'   \item{Site}{Number of the Experimental Sites}
#'   \item{MZ}{Productivity management zones within Farm, highlighting spatial variability in agricultural potential}
#'   \item{Experiment}{Number of the Experiments}
#'   \item{Stage}{Are of the sixth, tenth, and fourteenth expanded leaf and silking stages of maize (V6, V10, V14, and R1)}
#'   \item{Treatment}{The agronomic treatment involved the application of urea (46-0-0) at sowing, using five different nitrogen rates of 0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg per hectare. These rates are labeled as 0N, 60N, 120N, 180N, and 240N, respectively}
#'   \item{AGB}{Above-ground biomass (AGB) of maize in Mg or tn per hectare}
#'   \item{Nuptake}{Nitrogen uptake of maize in kg per hectare}
#'   \item{NNI}{nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) in maize}

#'   \item{VH}{C-SAR backscatter for the vertical horizontal (VH) in dB values from Sentinel-1 observations. The dB values of the VH backscatter were transformed into absolute values and divided by 100 values so that the VH values lie between 0 and 1, similar to the scale of the Sentinel-2 spectral bands}
#'   \item{VV}{C-SAR backscatter for the vertical vertical (VV) in dB values from Sentinel-1 observations.

#'   \item{VHxLIA}{C-SAR backscatter for the vertical horizontal (VH) in dB values, multiplied by Local Angle of Incidence (LIA) from Sentinel-1 observations. The VHxLIA backscatter values were converted to absolute values and divided by 1000 values so that the VHxLIA values lie between 0 and 1, similar to the scale of the Sentinel-2 spectral bands}
#'   \item{VVxLIA}{C-SAR backscatter for the vertical vertical (VV) in dB values, multiplied by Local Angle of Incidence (LIA) from Sentinel-1 observations. The VVxLIA backscatter values were converted to absolute values and divided by 1000 values so that the VVxLIA values lie between 0 and 1, similar to the scale of the Sentinel-2 spectral bands}
#'   \item{Ns}{Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) measures the amount of available nitrogen in the soil that can be immediately taken up by plants. This value was determined in the soil profile 0-60 when sowing maize and expressed in kg per hectare in the laboratory. The Ns values were then divided by 1000 values so that the Ns values lie between 0 and 1, similar to the scale of the Sentinel-2 spectral bands}
